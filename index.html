        How the Web Works
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a network of computers that communicate via the internet. When someone types in a web address their computer sends a
          <em>HTTP Request</em> to
          a <em>server</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the corresponding HTML document and sends
          it back to the computer where a <em> browser</em> interprets the code and displays it as the file requested.<p>
          Main components of the web include HTML (the main document type), URLs (web addresses), and HTTP (the main protocol the web runs on).

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML is the acronym for <em>Hypertext Markup
          Language.</em> HTML documents form most of the
          content on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain text
           which describes "what you see" and
          markup which describes
          "how it looks".

          HTML documents are made of HTML
          <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we
          tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML
          <b>tags</b>.

        <p>
          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
          or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them adding height and width.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" means that HTML
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
          think of this relationship like a family tree.
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
          inside of boxes, etc.

        <p>
          When an HTML document is read as
          text, you see a wave of indentations up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested it is.

        Text Editors (for programming)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers can use special text editors
          that make their lives easier. Some text editors add the closing tag when an opening is typed and some suggest tags as you type.

        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is very important. It makes editing easier and reduces errors by limiting the number of changes that have to be manually made to lines of code. 
        </p>

          By assigning the same class to divs throughout the document we can assign the same styles to similar parts without having to markup each part individually and risk making a mistake.

        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This allows programmers to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

          While people can sometimes make sense of sentences that may not be technically grammatically correct computers aren't smart enough to do this.
          Code must be written exactly "correct" according to the Python interpreter, otherwise
          it will not give us the intended result or will produce an error.

        <p>
          Variables give programmers a way to give <em>names</em> to <em>values.</em> If <span class="code">my_variable</span> is a variable with a value of  <span class="code">2</span>, then the following code would print out  <span class="code">0</span>:

        <p>
          <span class="code">my_variable = 2</span>
        </p>

    <h2>Lesson 3: Input -> Function -> Output</h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        What is a function, also known as a "procedure"?
      </div>

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output. For example, a function named <span class="code">square</span> might take a number as input and produce the square of that number as output.
        </p>
     </div>
   </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        What is the difference between <b>making</b> and <b>using</b> a function?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Functions are made by starting a line of code with the keyword <span class="code">def</span> (meaning define) and then giving the function a name followed by the function <b>parameters</b> in
           parentheses. These parameters will be replaced real values when the function is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the "body" of the function, we write the code that specifies what to do with the input. The following code could be the definition of a function called <span class="code">sum</span>:
          <div class="code-block">
            def sum(x,y): <br>
            <span class="indent">answer = x + y</span> <br>
            <span class="indent">return answer</span>
          </div>

        <p>
          To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. Like this:
          <div class="code-block">
            print sum(4,3) <br>
            >>>7

      <div class="concept-title">
        How do functions help programmers avoid repetition?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Functions can be created and reused over and over. Once you've defined a function, you never have to define it again.

        <p>
          The <span class="code">return</span> keyword tells Python  what the function should produce as output. If a function doesn't have a <span class="code">return</span> statement, then it does not know what to output and does nothing.

          An <span class="code">else</span> statement can be combined with an <span class="code">if</span> statement. An else statement contains the block of 
          code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a false value. An <span class="code">or</span> statement only evaluate what it needs.  I.E. if the 1st expression evaluates to true then the 2nd expression is not evaluated.  If the 1st expression evaluates to false then the value of the 2nd statement is used.
